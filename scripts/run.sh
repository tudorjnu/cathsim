# Request the number of CPU cores. (There are 24 CPU cores and 4 GPUs on each GPU node,
# so please request 6*Ngpu CPU cores, i.e., 6 CPU cores for 1 GPU, 12 CPU cores for 2 GPUs, and so on.
# User may request more CPU cores for jobs that need very large CPU memory occasionally, 
# but the number of CPU cores should not be greater than 6*Ngpu+5. Please email hpc-support if you need to do so.)
