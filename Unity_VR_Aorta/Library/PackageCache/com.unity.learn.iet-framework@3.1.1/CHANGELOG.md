# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this package adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.1.1] - 2022-08-30
### Added
- Added an error log when a folder without a Translator.cs file is selected as the target folder of content localization files
- Added support for dynamic rendering of tutorial page's paragraphs. This allows tutorial pages to have multiple paragraphs of the same type
- Tutorials can now have a "Completion dialog" which is displayed whenever a user completes the tutorial and goes back to the Table Of Content
- Added live authoring of the title of the Welcome/Completion Dialog window
- When going "back", criteria of the current page are checked again. This allows for redoing instructions of previous tutorial steps, assuming non-destructive operations have been performed since the start of the tutorial.

### Changed
- The minimum version of the editor compatible with the package is now 2020.3
- IET no longer creates the InitCodeMarker files to determine whether to show the welcome dialog or not. A project settings, editable from the "Preferences" menu, is used instead.
- Many public APIs have been marked as Obsolete. When you update to this version, the console will warn you about which APIs to use instead. APIs that became obsolete in this version will cause compilation errors in the next major version of IET, and will be removed completely later on.

### Fixed
- Fixed Criteria being still checked even if a tutorial was quit, slowing the editor down
- Fixed Criteria continuing checking while not testing, slowing the editor down
- Fixed tutorial masking settings-related inspector being broken in Unity 2021 LTS
- Fixed missing arrow icon in uncompleted tutorial instruction paragraphs
- Fixed "Object reference" inspector field being of the wrong size in Unity 2021 or higher
- Fixed live authoring of "Next" & "Done" buttons of Tutorial Pages not working
- Fixed "404 not found" warning logs appearing at project startup
- Fixed tutorial completion status not being properly loaded at project startup
- Fixed content localization files not appearing immediately after their generation
- Fixed live authoring of content localization files not working until a domain reload was triggered
- Fixed performance issues caused by unneeded calls to InternalEditorUtility.RepaintAllViews(), which caused the whole editor's UI to be redrawn
- Fixed performance issues caused by unnecessary redraws of the making/highlighting. The masking logic has been optimized to avoid redrawing of masking / highlighting when it is not needed
- Fixed masking data being constantly recalculated even when a tutorial wasn't running
- Fixed Tutorial URLs not being opened if they didn't start with http:// or https:// and didn't have at least a 3rd level domain in the url
- Fixed TutorialPage's "URL that points to local resource/folder/file" feature not working

## [2.2.1] - 2022-02-23
### Fixed
- Fixed one test failing when running in the Unity Editor's test environment

## [2.2.0] - 2022-02-14
### Added

- Added a possibility to specify which element(s) (the last, the first, all of them) is/are chosen for unmasking if multiple elements match the chosen selector.
- Added text wrapping for "narrative description" and "instruction description" fields of the Inspectors of tutorial pages

### Changed
- Documentation: Added PackageInstalledCriterion explanation

### Fixed

## [2.1.2] - 2022-01-17
### Changed
- Updated version number.

## [2.1.2-pre.2] - 2022-01-13
### Fixed
- Support for HTML character codes in Rich Text Parser (`&amp;` etc.).

- Fixed `BuildPlayer_Succeeds` test failing when the build target is not available.

## [2.1.0] - 2021-10-13
### Changed
- When traversing back to an already completed tutorial page, the masking settings of the page are reapplied if the page doesn't have completion criteria set.
This new behavior improves the tutorial authoring experience and allows a tutorial user to reobserve pages in "a tour of the UI" type of tutorials.
- When applying masking, do not not throw an exception if unmasked view's **Editor Window Type** or **View Type** is explicitly set to **None**, meaning, the masking is likely not fully configured yet.

- Fixed `SerializedType` values that were resolved but the resolved type had a different assembly-qualified type name than the original name being shown incorrectly as **None**. These values are now shown with a yellow background in the Inspector.
- Fixed NRE when auto-advancing a tutorial page with video on Unity 2021 and newer.

### Removed
- UI: Removed drop shadows from title and subtitle of tutorial category/project cards and tutorial window's header as the `text-shadow` USS property is not supported on Unity 2020 and older.

- Added sanitization for tutorial assets' text content so that unprintable control characters, for example, a carriage return, are removed automatically.
- Scripting API: Made `TutorialModalWindow` part of the public API of the package. This class can be used to implement welcome/closing dialogs for the tutorial project.
