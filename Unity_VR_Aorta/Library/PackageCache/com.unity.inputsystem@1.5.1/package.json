    "changelog": "### Fixed\n- Fixed unclosed profiler marker in `InvokeCallbacksSafe_AnyCallbackReturnsTrue` which would lead to eventually broken profiler traces in some cases like using `PlayerInput` (case ISXB-393).\n- Fixed InputAction.bindings.count not getting correctly updated after removing bindings with Erase().\n- Fixed an issue where connecting a gamepad in the editor with certain settings will cause memory and performance to degrade ([case UUM-19480](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-19480)).\n- Fixed issue leading to a stack overflow crash during device initialization in `InsertControlBitRangeNode` (case ISXB-405).\n- Fixed the issue where saving and loading override bindings to JSON would set unassigned overrides (that were `null`) to assigned overrides (as an empty string `\"\"`)."
